                Hey there! I'm Anirudh, and I'm a 24' at MIT studying Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Math. 
              </p>

              <p>
                Currently I'm a member of the Hackmit dev team, so I've been busy contributing to our projects you can find on techX.
                One of the most exciting tasks I worked on was on making a puzzle, where I decided to learn some Solidity and make a next gen decentralized puzzle.

              <p>
                In highschool, I participated in a lots computer science contests(and I was not very good at first ðŸ˜‚). But in my junior year I managed to qualify for USACO platinum, and me and <a href="/top_lads.png">my friends</a> even won some statewide contests in Florida!
              </p>

              <p>
                When I'm away from the pc I enjoy walking around to explore and hopefully find some cool new places to eat.
                And if I need a break at the pc, I'll usually get on a game of league.
